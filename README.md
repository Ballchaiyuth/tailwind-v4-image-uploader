## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ballchaiyuth/tailwind-image-uploader.git
cd tailwind-image-uploader
```

### 2. Install & Run

You can use either **Yarn** or **npm** — the app will start automatically after install!

```bash
# with npm
npm install

# or with yarn
yarn
```

> This works because of the `postinstall` script which runs `vite` automatically.
